Chrome password stealing 

In simple terms the script is self explanatory and goes to:

-"%APPDATA%\..\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data"

where the passwords and usernames are stored

-decrypt them

-and prints the list of usernames and passwords

My Remote Function

Of course I couldn't resist to modify this script and to add a function that takes the list, stores It to a txt file and send It via gmail wherever I want to.

So If anyone on any machine clicks this script(exe) then all his google chrome credentials will be sent to a gmail account.
